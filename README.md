Some utility scripts I use.

## Message on WhatsApp

This script is intended to be used as a bookmard on the web browser. After adding the bookmark, select a text containing a phone number in any webpage and click the bookmark to start a WhatsApp chat with that phone. If no phone number is selected, when you click the bookmark you can type or paste a phone number on the popup that opens to start a conversation with it.

#### Setup

Just add a new bookmark with the URL being this script (you name it!).
