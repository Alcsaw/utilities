Some utility scripts I use.

## Message on WhatsApp

This script is intended to be used as a bookmard on the web browser. Then, when you click the bookmark you can paste a phone number on the popup and it will open a conversation with it on WhatsApp.

#### Setup

Just add a new bookmark with the URL being this script (you name it!).
